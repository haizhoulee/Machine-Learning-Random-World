//! The random-world crate.
//!
//! A crate implementing Machine Learning ML methods for confident prediction
//! (e.g., Conformal Predictors) and related ones introduced in the book
//! Algorithmic Learning in a Random World ([ALRW](http://alrw.net/)).
//!
//!
//! # Goals
//! * Fast implementation of methods introduced in the book ALRW.
//! * Should easily allow to wrap existing rust implementations of ML
//!   classifiers/scorers.
//! * (Maybe) allow interfacing to Python.
//! * (Maybe) can be called as a binary.
//!
