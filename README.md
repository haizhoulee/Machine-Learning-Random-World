This project provides a `rust` implementation of Machine Learning methods for confident prediction such as Conformal Predictors and related ones brought up from the book Algorithmic Learning in a Random World ([ALRW](http://alrw.net/)), offering standalone binaries as well.

## Goals

A few of the main goals for developing this library include:

- Fast implementation of methods outlined in the ALRW book
- Maintain quality documentation
- Provide standalone binaries
- CP method should be functional with scoring classifiers from existing ML libraries (e.g., [rusty-machine](https://athemathmo.github.io/rusty-machine/doc/rusty_machine/), [rustlearn](https://maciejkula.github.io/rustlearn/doc/rustlearn/))
- Facilitate easy interfacing with other languages like Python

The README has a lot more interesting and useful information, do explore it for specifics on installing binaries, running CP predictions, scoring classifiers, various commands and their explanations, working with the library, featured methods, author, and a brief about similar projects.

Happy exploring! The Project owner will be happy to have your contribution! Thank you and have a great time operating this repo!
